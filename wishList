Things for the immediate future:

	Host on Heroku when at least 95% functional (backend-wise)
	Clean the code
	Optimization
	Testing

Things for the far future:
	Get someone to make a background image for the app so that it doesn't look like it's just for the Cebu Chapter
	Change the images of the forms to something else, maybe some graphics napud
	In about change the group photo to something else, preferably the logo lang or another graphic
	Team, change the content to something totally different or make it dynamic?(making it adapt to the different chapters is data intensive; storage-wise)
