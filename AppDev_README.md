This group worked on: 
1)login 
2)signup( 2nd iteration that the client,Red Cross Youth Cebu Chapter, wanted to see)
3)Membership form
4)Uniform Request form (Receipt/Received portion untouched, client decided to not have that portion anymore)

  The remaining forms were left untouched because the client decided to have some changes now that their forms are digital.
The remaining forms, however, have their tables/models in the directories for preparation purposes and minor implementations.
